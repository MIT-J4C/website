The IDF film “Bearing Witness” depicts 47 minutes of graphic, horrifying violence from October 7th created and screened to elicit strong, pro-war reactions. Victims’ and hostages’ family members have asked [this film not be aired out of respect for their loved ones who were brutalized and murdered on camera](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mental-health-professionals-implore-netanyahu-not-to-show-atrocities-film-to-public/). We question the motivation for allowing a foreign military film to be shown to the leaders of MIT while that same military has murdered tens of thousands of Palestinians and continues to relentlessly bomb Gaza to rubble.

MIT Jews for Ceasefire stand firm in our belief that airing this film is an attempt to **_justify and distract from the genocide of the Palestinian people_** and the obliteration of Gaza. Just today, Israeli airstrikes murdered at least 46 Palestinians in the Jabalia refugee camp, and another Israeli airstrike struck a residential building near the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah killing many more.

Our Jewish values compel us to speak up against these abhorrent injustices. We will not let our grief as Jews be weaponized to justify the genocide in Gaza, and we condemn any propaganda that attempts to do so.
